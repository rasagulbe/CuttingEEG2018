## Separating different alpha sources

Although the M/EEG community generally agrees on the existence of multiple generators of the alpha-band (7â€“13 Hz) rhythm, there is little consensus on methods for separating them. This tutorial presents analytical and experimental approaches to isolate different alpha sources using: (1) independent component analysis (ICA), a multivariate source separation technique that combines information from all electrodes and identifies independent sources of activity based on the statistical structure of the data; and (2) resonance responses to rhythmic visual stimulation. The tutorial also covers procedures for determining the spectral properties of multiple alpha generators, including peak frequency and alpha-band width.
